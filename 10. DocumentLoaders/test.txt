Joke:
Why did the cricket team bring string to the match?

Because they wanted to tie the score!

Explanation:
This joke plays on the double meaning of the word "tie."

In cricket, a tie happens when both teams end the match with the exact same score — which is pretty rare.

But in everyday language, "to tie something" also means to use a string or rope to fasten things together.

So, the humor comes from imagining a cricket team misunderstanding the term and literally bringing string to “tie” the score — as if that would help them draw the match!

It's a classic pun — a joke that uses a word with two meanings for a humorous twist.
